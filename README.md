Welcome to the ultimate fullstack boilerplate for rapid prototyping and MVP development! This boilerplate combines the power and flexibility of Python and JavaScript frameworks, providing you with a robust foundation to kickstart your ideas.

## üî• Why Choose This Boilerplate?

This project is crafted to help you bring your ideas to life quickly and efficiently. With this boilerplate, you can mix and match backend and frontend technologies to fit your needs, including:

- **Backend Frameworks**: 
  - Python: **Django**, **Flask**, **Pyramid**
- **Frontend Frameworks**:
  - JavaScript: **React.js**, **Vue.js**
- **Databases**:
  - SQL: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**
  - NoSQL: **MongoDB**
  - Vector Database: **Qdrant**

Each component is designed to work harmoniously, making it possible to swap frameworks or databases with minimal configuration. This flexibility is especially useful for prototyping, proofs of concept (POC), or MVPs where adaptability is key.

## üöÄ Features to Get You Started Quickly

- **Pre-built APIs**: Essential routes like `register`, `login`, and various test endpoints are already included. These provide user authentication (JWT token-based) and role-based permissions to get you up and running quickly.
- **Modular Architecture**: The boilerplate structure encourages scalability and clean code, making it easier to extend and adapt as your project grows.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Implemented across all backends to support secure and unified user authentication, compatible across Flask, Django, React and Vue frontends.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This boilerplate includes:

1. **Backend**: Ready-to-use code for Flask, Django, and Pyramid APIs with JWT authentication and common utility functions.
2. **Frontend**: Sample projects with React and Vue that you can adapt to fit your specific UI requirements.
3. **Database Configurations**: Dockerized database configurations for MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Qdrant, allowing you to test with SQL, NoSQL, and vector databases.

## ‚ú® Key Benefits
